## You define your politics, politics doesn't define you

We don't believe in blind loyalty to a political party (whether nation state or community). We start with the outcomes you care about, and end with the politics and political affiliations to get us there.

## We work in the real

Politics and democracy is a tool to build a better society, not the other way around. We're interested in outcomes, solutions, and impacts to real people everywhere. We don't work in the abstract. We work in the real, where there are real benefits and real consequences.

## We believe in openness

Whether it's Govrn or Politics, we believe in open systems that are transparently designed. We don't need to burn the existing world down, just the walls that currently divide us.

## We take ownership

Solutions to our problems start with someone stepping up. This is true even if that means we're left holding the bag. We will always be the person that tried to fix the problem, rather than the person that never tried.

## Believe in the best

We always believe in the best in people. When in doubt, we believe people will rise to the occasion.

## We take responsibility for our actions

We take responsibility for our faults and failures - no matter what the consequences.

## Our community drives us

We have the best community around. Our community doesn't only support us, it inspires us to be the best we can be. Our motivation comes from this inspiration.

## We do the work

The more power you receive as a community member or constituent, the more responsibility you take on as well. We want to be responsible and thoughtful members, within our community and between others. We take on the responsibility with a smile.
