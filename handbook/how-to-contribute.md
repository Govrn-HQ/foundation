# Notes

## We're pscyhed you're here

- We want more contributors rather than less. This document is a way too highlight our norms and processes for you to use
- Use this guide to understand how to grow within the community as well. Learn more about this at [contribute-to-hire](../contribute-to-hire.md)

## Contributor vs ....

There is a difference between being a contributor vs everything else. And that's what we want, you to be a contributor. Sometimes it's easier to understand what being a contributor is if you know what it is not. Being a contributor vs a:

1. Contractor: Contractors are mostly told what to do. We think this is odd, since most of the time you're the ones building, using, and experience the change we're making. We want you to split your time as a Govrn contributor submitting actual content (build) and submitting ideas and thoughts (collaboration).
1. Investor: Investors give only time or money to a project once and then go away forevery. Contributors give both time and money but in a way that encourages ongoing contributions.
1. Users: Users use the product but aren't allowed to submit or build improvements. Othertimes, users will "lob grenades" by throwing out an idea but never following up on it. Contributors provide ideas, follow up with "why", and follow on with iterations.

Likewise, we reward contributors with additional influence and responsibilty over our decisions.

## Process on becoming a Contributor

1. Make a README
2. Find an Issue or Repo to work on
3. Make a contribution

We like keep it simple.

## Process for Contributing

1. Make a proposal
2. Post about it in the `# ðŸ™Œ-come-contribute` channel in [discord](https://discord.com/channels/837049837886767125/910702904388767744) asking for async feedback.
3. If more than 3 people comment or express interest, ask a Govrn Mod to create a channel for you
