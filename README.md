> ## **Anything that governs you, you should be able to govrn.**

# ðŸ§­ Foundation

Govrn believe in the open source movement. We believe in transparency. We believe that the community is stronger than the individual.

We want to clearly state the principles we believe in, and the principles we reject. This repo shows just that and allows our community to fully see, understand, and contribute to it as well.

This is meant to be a living document that anyone can add to or change. We aren't defined by the institution, but rather our movement members define the instution. Anyone can add to this repo, or fork of it and make a better version.

We created the repo for you to understand what we're about and learn how to contribute. Anything you see in this repo is fair game for you to change.

We are here for you, not the other way around.

This means the main question is, what do you want to be defined by.

## ðŸŒž What we're about

We believe that anything that governs you, you should be able to govern. We believe that this is true for everything from your local PTA, to your online club, to your Governor, and all the way up to your national politicians.

Anything that governs you, you should be able to govern. That is what true partnership is. It means changing governance and politics from something that is "extractive" or "zero sum" and turning it into "collaborative" and "positive sum".

We know that the vision and philosophy of DAOs, Open Source, and Decentralization can enable that. It's our goal to help bring that vision to reality.

To do this, we're building DAO tools that can be used for any type of community, but we are building the eco-system to enable these tools to work in our physical governments.

## ðŸ—‚ Sections

This repo has a couple several folders and sections to pay attention to:

1. **Principles**: Our principles folder contains the principles we hold ourself to. This includes our values, mission statement, and vision.
2. **Govrn Movement Model:** We want people to understand how we award our Movement Model Points. Our Movement Model shows all the different ways to earn Govrn governance points and become a community contributor to Govrn.
3. **Issues:** The issues repo contains three types of issues:
   1. Contribution Proposals: These are ideas, proposals, and initiatives that both the core Govrn Team the community comes up with (these are similar to bounties). Submitting a proposal is open to anyone and everyone. Currently completing a proposal is open to the public, but in the future we will require you to have "joined" the Govrn Movement (dw, it's permissionless to join ðŸ˜Ž )
   2. Bugs: Bugs are questions, concerns, or thoughts that anyone in the community has. Are you concerned with our incentive model? Submit an issue. Maybe you don't understand why we started Govrn? Submit an issue. This is the place for all your questions.
   3. Change Requests: Change requests are requests you can make to modify any section of this repo. We know that sometimes before you are ready to submit a PR and change our actual docs, it's helpful to talk ideas out. Submit an issue to create a discussion around a potential PR you're thinking of submitting.
4. **Govrn Community Initiatives:** Within the Govrn Community, Govrn members are running and leading their own initiatives. Sometimes these are related to our products, and others they're just initiatives that our community finds interesting. We want to provide the structure and support to any of our members that want to start and lead an initiative. Find our current initiatives you can join listed in this folder, or suggest a new one by submitting a `Contribution Proposal` in the Issues section.
